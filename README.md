This project I have created the dice game 21. The point of the game is to roll the die and get 21. You can choose if you want to play the game with one or two dice. You can roll, reset your roll, stop and reset the match history. You play against a computer who rolls until they get the same number as you, 21 or over 21. If you get over 21 you lose the game, if you get 21 you win and if the computer gets the same as you, you lose. I use classes to create the dice rolling and then i use php sites to the display the information. In a functions file i have a bunch of functions that work together with the classes to create the code and game you see.
